            <p>Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves (/ˈeɪviːz/), characterised by feathers, 
                toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton.
                Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species,
                more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups
                without wings 
                are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which evolved from forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly,
                although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species.
                The digestive and respiratory systems of 
                birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, 
                have further evolved for swimming. <br></p>
